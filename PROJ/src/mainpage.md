The FlashPhoto project include two simple applications for graphic interface users. One application is a painting application with many tools and filters for image processing. The other application, called MIA, focuses on using for medical photos, which has fewer functionality than but have a specific feature of editing image: using command lines in terminal. These two applications are very interesting to use and play with as well as hoping the modification from people around the world to make the project better everyday.

The following is the navigation part of FlashPhoto and MIA applications' documentation. There are two separted links for users "User Guide" and developers "Developer Resources."
