/** @brief Base class for all image editor commands. Each command knows how to execute
 itself, including sending and required parameters to the image editor. This
 structure follows the Command Design Pattern.  The command pattern is also
 often used to implement undo.  However, we don't do that here because all of
 the commands get "undone" in exactly the same way -- we simply restore the
 pixel buffer that was in place before the command was executed.  So, it's
 quite clean to implement the undo feature directly within the ImageEditor
 class, which simply maintains a list of previous pixel buffers.  The main
 reason for implementing these command wrappers around the image editor
 functionality is to be able to easily create a list of commands to run later
 while parsing command line arguments.  If instead we just processed each
 command as it appears on the command line (e.g., blur then threshold then ...)
 the process can potentially run for quite a long time before discovering that
 there is an error in the syntax at the end of the command line.  So, it is nice
 to be able to parse the whole command line first building up a list of commands
 to send to the image editor and then, if the whole command line looks good, run
 the whole list of commands. */
